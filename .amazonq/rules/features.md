## These are the features I want to keep or combine:
- Keep dark/light mode toggle
- Keep custom animations, transitions, and visual effects
- Adopt responsive navigation for all screen sizes, from mobile to large monitors. 
- Adopt resume page should follow the class project code, idm222, instead of having a photo of a resume
- Adopt in accessibility with the hidden text for screen readers, better HTML structure, etc. 
- Implement mobile-first CSS from class project: 
  - The desktop view should visually still be the same as the original, keeping the larger project boxes, larger font, etc. 
- Clean code that is maintainable with CSS hierarchies such as:
  - selectors are ordered from least specific to most specific
  - properties are listed alphabetically 
  - media queries are all at the bottom
  - variables and animations are at the top
- Add normalize.css 
- Stick with basic HTML and CSS. If something can be done without Javascript, do it that way instead, if not, keep the Javascript code. 
- Ensure all file paths/links are correct


## Features to add at later date
- Masonry layout for photography pages
- Image optimization for these photos for select photos?
- Add more project boxes for new projects
  - Full HTML pages for these projects describing implementation process, design choices, and any impediments. 
  - timesheet
  - humble bundle redesign
  - any other challenge assignments 
- When this website appears as a link on google, I want the link to say "Sophia Bartolacci | Computer Science Student"


## Features that need fixing
- background for dark/light mode toggle switch is barely visible
- load in animations for resume
- about text layout
- better hamburger style menu
